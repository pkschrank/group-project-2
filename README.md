This is our attempt at creating some code that analyzes the SP-500 index, creates a buy signal target variable, and predicts the success of the buy signal based on next day positive return. Our goal is to meet or exceed a 75% balanced accuracy score.

1) Create an install package list
2) Read and load SP-500 index data into a dataframe from YahooFinance (yf)
3) Clean up Data set
4) Perform Feature Engineering
    Moving Averages
    RSI
    MACD
    Bollinger Bands
5) Perform Winsorization of Data
6) Perform Train and Test Splits
7) Perform Scaling
8) Perform and display results from various Classifications
